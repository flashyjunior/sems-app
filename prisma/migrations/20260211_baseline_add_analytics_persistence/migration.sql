-- Baseline migration: add-analytics-persistence
-- Generated: 2026-02-11
-- NOTE: This is a baseline migration created after applying schema with `prisma db push`.
-- The development database was already synchronized with `schema.prisma`, so
-- there are no additional DDL statements to run here. This file records a
-- baseline migration so future `prisma migrate` commands have a starting point.

-- If you prefer to include the full schema DDL here, you can replace this
-- content with the output of `pg_dump --schema-only` for the target database.

-- No-op baseline
